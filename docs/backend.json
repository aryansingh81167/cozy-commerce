    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure prioritizes security, scalability, and debuggability, adhering to the core design principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC, and QAPs. It uses path-based ownership for user data and avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies by ensuring all collections have homogeneous security postures.\n\nThe structure is designed around the `User` entity. User-specific data is stored under `/users/{userId}`. This provides simple path-based ownership, where only the authenticated user can access their data. The `users` collection utilizes the standard user id provided by Firebase Authentication (via `request.auth.uid`).\n\nAuthorization Independence (Denormalization):\nThis design achieves authorization independence by storing authorization relevant data directly within the documents where it's needed, avoiding `get()` calls in security rules. In this basic implementation, since there are no collaborative documents, denormalization isn't explicitly needed. If collaborative features are added later (e.g., shared wishlists), a `members` map on those documents would be used to denormalize access control.\n\nQAPs (Rules are not Filters):\nThe path-based structure (e.g., `/users/{userId}/...`) inherently supports secure `list` operations. Rules can easily grant access to a user to list documents under their own user ID without exposing other users' data.  Because all documents under `/users/{userId}` belong to the user, a simple rule can allow `list` access based on `request.auth.uid == userId`."
