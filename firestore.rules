/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Cozy Commerce.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data stored under their unique user ID.
 * Data Structure: All user data is nested under /users/{userId}, where {userId} corresponds to the Firebase Authentication UID.
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Users cannot list all user accounts (no global `list` access on `/users`).
 *  - Data validation is relaxed to facilitate prototyping, but authorization is strictly enforced.
 *  - Denormalization is used to simplify authorization logic.
